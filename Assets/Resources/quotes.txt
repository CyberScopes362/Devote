Never do tomorrow what you can do <b>today</b>.
Wake up with <b>determination</b>. Go to bed with <b>satisfaction</b>.
It always seems to be <b>impossible</b> until it's done.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
There is no elevator to success; you must take the stairs.
Are your <b>excuses</b> more important than your <b>dreams</b>?
The secret to getting ahead is <b>getting started</b>.
Do it now. Sometimes <b>'later'</b> becomes <b>'never'</b>.
If it is important to you, you will find a way. If not, you will find an excuse.
Work hard in silence; Let success make the noise.
Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, <b>you'll land among the stars</b>.
Go to bed with a <b>dream</b>. Wake up with a purpose</b>.
Stop saying <b>"I wish."</b> Start saying <b>"I will."</b>
Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.
Create the life you can't wait to wake up to.
Ask yourself if what you're doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow.
Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.
When the world says <b>"Give up."</b> Hope whispers <b>"Try one more time."</b>
Failure will never overtake you if your determination to succeed is strong enough.
Determination <b>today</b> leads to success <b>tomorrow</b>.
What you are looking for is not out there... <b>it's in you</b>.
If you can imagine it, you can <b>achieve it</b>. If you can dream it, you can <b>become it</b>.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to success is always to try <b>just one more time</b>.
The expert in anything was once a begginer.
Don't be afraid to fail; Be afraid not to try.
<b>Do it</b> because they said <b>you couldn't</b>.
Don't be upset with the results you didn't get with the work you didn't do.
You'll never be successful if you don't encounter failure.
You've got what it takes, but it will take everything you got.
You can't have a better tomorrow if you're still thinking about yesterday.
If you change nothing, nothing will change.
You can't put a limit on anything. The more you dream, the farther you get.
Your <b>"I can"</b> is more important than your IQ.
A person who never made a mistake never tried something new.
Failure keeps you humble, success keeps you glowing, but only <b>determination</b> keeps you going.
Replace excuses with effort. Replace laziness with determination. And everything else will fall into place.
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes <b>sweat, determination and hard work</b>.
Failures are part of life. If you don't fail, you don't learn. If you don't learn, you'll never change.
Believe you can... and you're halfway there.
If it was easy, everyone would do it.
A dream becomes a goal when action is taken towards achievement.
I'm not telling you it's going to be easy, I'm telling you it's going to be worth it.
Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.
It never gets easier, you only just get better.
Stars can't <b>shine</b> without <b>darkness</b>.
Don't count the days, make the days count.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
You are confined only by the walls <b>you build yourself</b>.
The struggle you're in today is developing the strength you need for tomorrow.
Don't stop when you are tired, stop when you are done.
The only place where <b>'success'</b> comes before <b>'work'</b> is in the dictionary.
Failure is the <b>opportunity</b> to begin again more intelligently.
